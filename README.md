PURPOSE:
The purpose of this site is to give basic descriptions of a few of my favorite New York
City neighborhoods.  New York City is a place dear to my heart and, I aim to use my website
to provide pictures and informations that illustrate why I love it so much.  I would like 
to create visual interest with my layouts and graphics.

BREAKPOINTS:
Breakpoints were added for tablet viewing at 700px and desktop viewing at 1000px.  For each page, navigation changed from vertically stacked nav items in mobile view, 
to two rows and two columns of nav items (each taking up 50% of the page width), to
a horizontal nav with each nav item taking up 25% of the page width.  Each page's items 
are vertically stacked for the mobile view, one item in each row.  The most change 
happens on the "Midtown" page.  Desktop and tablet view are the same except for the final 
row which changes from four items in a row to two rows of two items.  All of these changes 
can be seen on the CSS stylesheet with media queries.
	
THREE-UP COLUMN DESKTOP LAYOUT:
Page 2, for the Midtown neighborhood, highlights many famous sites in the area.  It is
arranged in three rows.  Row 1: 3 items with headers, pictures, and text.  Row 2: 2 items
with headers, pictures, and text.  Row 3: 4 items with headers and text only.

CSS CONTINUOUS LOOP ANIMATION:
This occurs on the Midtown page for the Times Square graphic.  It has a 3 second pulse to 
grow by 15% and then shrink back to its original size.

CSS ANIMATION WITH INTERACTION:
This also occurs on the Midtown page for the Radio City Music Hall graphic.  When the user
hovers over the image, it skews on the X axis 20 degrees.

BACKGROUND IMAGE:
I included a non-repeating background image on each page at the top.  It accents the main
header and is a unifying feature throughout the site.  I like the basic background,
especially with all of the images I included, so I chose to have it appear only on the top
and not repeat throughout the entirety of each page.

JQUERY INTERACTION:
My jQuery interaction appears on the Central Park page.  I created a button that says
"Let it Snow" and formatted it so that when it is clicked, the picture of a fall scene in
Central Park changes to a snowy day picture.
